The Bitcho is an experimental simulation of a digital organism. 
Built from binary trigrams and hexagrams (â˜°â€“â˜·). 000-111 000.000-111.111
Each cell in the universe combines logical gates (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNORâ€¦)
that evolve, mutate, and interact with their neighbors.

The system generates in real time:

ðŸ§  Logical mutations and evolution
ðŸŽ¨ ASCII visualization of the living entity (face + body)
ðŸ”Š Sound synthesis using SoX based on system energy (made for my termux setup)
ðŸ’¾ Autonomous evolution with save/load state (universo.json)

A mix of generative art, digital biology, and computational logic.
 just ctrl+c out XD
